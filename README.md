## Modifying C# User Snippets in Visual Studio Code

### Open Visual Studio Code:
1. Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

### Access User Snippets:

#### Method 1: Using the Menu
1. Navigate to the menu bar and click on **File**.
2. Select **Preferences**, and then choose **User Snippets**.
3. Choose **C#**.

#### Method 2: Using the Command Palette (Quick Access)
1. Press **Ctrl + shift+ P** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + shift + P** (Mac) to open the command palette.
2. Type `>Preferences: Configure User Snippets` and press **Enter**.
3. Choose **C#**.

This will open the user snippets file where you can modify or add new snippets for your C# scripts in Unity.

## Locate or Create the Snippet:

5. If you already have a snippet named "controller," locate it in the `C#.json` file.
6. If not, create a new snippet file by clicking on the "New Global Snippets file..." option. Name it `C#.json` if it doesn't already exist.

## Edit the Snippet:

7. Once you have the `C#.json` file open, find or add the "controller" snippet.
8. Modify the existing snippet or replace it with the corrected snippet provided earlier.

## Save the Changes:

9. After making your modifications, save the `C#.json` file.

## Verify Changes:

10. Open a C# file in Visual Studio Code.
11. Type the snippet prefix (e.g., `controller`) and press `Tab` to trigger the snippet.
