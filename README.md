# Modifying C# User Snippets in Visual Studio Code

## Open Visual Studio Code:

1. Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

## Access User Snippets:

2. Navigate to the menu bar and click on **File**.
3. Select **Preferences**, and then choose **User Snippets**.
4. Choose **C#**.

## Locate or Create the Snippet:

5. If you already have a snippet named "controller," locate it in the `C#.json` file.
6. If not, create a new snippet file by clicking on the "New Global Snippets file..." option. Name it `C#.json` if it doesn't already exist.

## Edit the Snippet:

7. Once you have the `C#.json` file open, find or add the "controller" snippet.
8. Modify the existing snippet or replace it with the corrected snippet provided earlier.

## Save the Changes:

9. After making your modifications, save the `C#.json` file.

## Verify Changes:

10. Open a C# file in Visual Studio Code.
11. Type the snippet prefix (e.g., `controller`) and press `Tab` to trigger the snippet.
